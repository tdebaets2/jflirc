<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>This plug-in adds WinLIRC support to
<a href="http://www.cowonamerica.com/products/jetaudio/">jetAudio</a> (see <a href="#winlirc">next item</a> if you don't know what 
WinLIRC is). jetAudio is an excellent media player supporting all common audio 
and video formats. It already has built-in support for Microsoft Media Center 
and Streamzap remote controllers, but this doesn't work for other types of 
remotes, and can't be configured at all (the key bindings can't be changed). In 
contrast, you can use every remote supported by WinLIRC with this plug-in 
(almost any standard remote control). You also get full control over the key 
bindings, allowing you to adjust them to your own likings.</p>
<p>Requirements: Windows XP or higher, jetAudio 7 or higher</p>

<h3><a name="winlirc"></a>What is WinLIRC?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> (Linux Infrared Remote Control) is 
open source software to receive infrared signals on Linux. The most important 
part of LIRC is the server, which decodes received infrared signals and notifies 
a 
connected client  of these signals. Whenever a key on the remote is pressed, 
the server sends a message to the client to inform it of this key press. 
The fact that it's a server and client doesn't necessarily mean that they have 
to connect through the Internet. In most cases, the server and client are just 
locally running programs using local connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evidently, <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/">WinLIRC</a> is the Windows 
equivalent of LIRC. This plug-in for jetAudio only acts as 
a client, so you will need a WinLIRC server first. This has the 
advantage  that you can use any WinLIRC server, depending on your type 
of  remote controller. The <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/">
original WinLIRC server</a> only supports infrared remotes, but you can setup a WinLIRC server for X10 (radio-frequency) remotes too, using <a href="http://rwkeymaster.sourceforge.net/rwkm_readme.htm">RW Key 
Master</a> together with <a href="http://remotew.free.fr/plugins.htm#winlirc">a
plug-in that starts a WinLIRC server</a>.</p>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a name="config"></a>Configuring the plug-in</h3>

<p>There is currently no user interface to configure the plug-in, but the 
settings can be changed relatively easily by editing the plug-in's INI file 
directly, with 
a simple text editor such as Notepad (more information about INI files
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">here</a>). The settings file is called JFLirc.ini 
and can  be found in one of the following locations, depending on your 
version of Windows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Windows XP and Server 2003</b>: C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application 
Data\COWON\JetAudio</li>
  <li><b>Windows Vista and newer:</b> C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\COWON\JetAudio</li>
</ul>

<p>It's possible that this file doesn't exist yet 
and that you need to create it manually first. When you make changes to the 
file, you need to restart jetAudio for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>The configuration file has two main sections: <b>Settings</b> contains general plug-in settings, and <b>Keys</b> 
is the place where key bindings can be defined (each binding assigns a key on the remote to an action in jetAudio).</p>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h4><a name="configgeneral"></a>General settings</h4>

<h5>WinLircHost</h5>

<p>Default value: localhost</p>

<p>The host on which the WinLIRC server is running. This can be a hostname, but 
also an IP address. In most cases, the server will run on the same system as jetAudio, which means that the 
value needs to be localhost (this is also the default value that will be used 
when the setting isn't explicitly specified in the INI file).</p>

<h5>WinLircPort</h5>

<p>Default value: 8765</p>

<p>The port that the WinLIRC server is listening on, and thus the plug-in should 
use to connect to the server. The listening port can usually be set in the 
server's configuration, and that port number should match the port number 
specified here. If they don't, the plug-in won't be able to connect. 8765 is the default port for WinLIRC connections. </p>

<h5>WinLircServer</h5>

<p>Default value: empty</p>

<p>By default, the plug-in will show an error message when it is unable to 
connect to a WinLIRC server using the configured (or default) host and port. 
However, when this setting is nonempty and contains the filename to a valid 
executable file, the plug-in will launch that executable instead of displaying an error. This 
allows for automatic launching of the WinLIRC server: specify the filename to 
the server here, and the plug-in will start it for you if it isn't already running.</p>

<p>After the plug-in has started the server, 
it will again try to connect a certain number of times (see next 
setting). If all these tries still fail, the plug-in will eventually display an error message. 
Please note that the plug-in won't launch anything if it's able to connect to 
the server on the very first try.</p>

<h5>MaxRetries</h5>

<p>Default value: 3</p>

<p>It's not uncommon that the WinLIRC server first needs a few seconds to initialize before it 
is able to accept connections from clients. This is why the plug-in can try to 
connect a few times after it has automatically launched the server (see previous 
setting), before eventually giving up and displaying an error message. There are generally about 2 seconds between 
two subsequent tries, so the default value of 3 gives the server approximately 6 
seconds to initialize. This should be more than enough, but it's always possible 
to increase the value if the server needs more time to initialize, and the 
plug-in gives up connecting too early.</p>

<p>Please note that, like the previous setting, this has no effect when the 
plug-in is able to connect to the server on the very first try.</p>

<h5>NoConnectFailedWarning</h5>

<p>Default value: 0</p>

<p>Set this to 1 to disable the error message that the plug-in displays when it 
is unable to connect to the WinLIRC server. This is generally not recommended, 
because it is  the only way to know if the connection failed (there are 
no other indications of a successful or failed connection). The only possible 
scenario for this is when the WinLIRC server isn't always running while using 
jetAudio, and you want to prevent the error message from appearing on every 
jetAudio start-up.</p>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h4><a name="configbindings"></a>Key bindings</h4>

<p>Every item in the <b>Keys</b> section assigns a key on the remote controller 
to an action in jetAudio. Its name is a key name, and its value a jetAudio 
action. Thus, all items should have the following format:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&lt;key name&gt;=&lt;jetAudio action&gt;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&lt;key name&gt; should be the name of a key on the remote as it is sent by the 
WinLIRC server, and &lt;jetAudio action&gt; an action from <a href="#configactions">
the list of possible jetAudio actions</a> (both without &lt; and &gt;). There can be 
at most one item for each key name. When there are several items with the same 
key name, the plug-in will only 
see the first  and ignore all others. It is allowed to assign more than one 
key to the same jetAudio action.</p>

<p>The following example binds the mute key of the remote to the togglemute 
action in jetAudio:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>mute=togglemute</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Hint:</b> if you don't know the WinLIRC key names of your remote, you can 
let the plug-in automatically add them to the INI file. Just follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that the Keys section is empty (this is not really necessary, 
  but it's usually a good idea to start off with a clean section).</li>
  <li>Check if the WinLIRC server is running, start jetAudio, and make sure that 
  the plug-in has connected to the server (no error message is displayed).</li>
  <li>Press every key on the remote (except the on/off key). For each 
  key that is pressed, and whose name doesn't exist in the Keys section yet, the 
  plug-in will write a new entry to the INI file with the key's name. As a 
  result, the Keys section should now contain the names of all the keys on your 
  remote when you reopen the INI file. The value of each newly added item is 
  left empty (no text after the equals sign), meaning that no jetAudio action 
  has been assigned to the key yet.</li>
  <li>You can now easily bind each key to a <a href="#configactions">jetAudio 
  action</a> by entering the action next to the corresponding key name (right 
  after the equals sign). Save the INI file when you're done and restart 
  jetAudio for the changes to take effect.</li>
</ul>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h4><a name="configactions"></a>Possible jetAudio actions</h4>

<p>This is a list of all the jetAudio actions that can be assigned to a key in 
the Keys section, and a short description of each action. Bindings to an action 
not in this list will be ignored by the plug-in.</p>
